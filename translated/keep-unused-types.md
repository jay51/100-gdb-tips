#Keep unused type

## example

```
#include <stdio.h>

union Type {
int a;
int *b;
};

int main ()
{
printf("sizeof(union Type) is %lu\n", sizeof(union Type));
return 0;
}
```

## Tips

The program generated by compiling with `gcc -g` is not including the symbol information of the union type:

(gdb) p sizeof(union Type)
No union type named Type.

If you want gcc to retain these type information that is not being used (guessing that sizeof should be replaced with a constant at compile time, so gcc thinks that union Type is an unused type), you can use `gcc -g -fno-eliminate- Unused-debug-types` to compile:

```
(gdb) p sizeof(union Type)
$1 u003d 8
```
See the [gcc manual] (https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options)
